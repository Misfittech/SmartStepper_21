 *  When it comes to the stepper driver if we use angles
 *  we will always have a rounding error. For example
 *  a 0-65536(360) angle for 1.8 degree step is 327.68 so
 *  if you increment 200 of these as 327 you have a 13.6 error
 *  after one rotation.
 *  If you use floating point the effect is the same but takes longer.
 *
 *  The only error-less accumulation system is to use native units, ie full
 *  steps and microsteps.
